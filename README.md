# Paletteer

A tool for creating color palettes that can be exported to various formats, such as CSS, SCSS and Tailwind config.

The method of making the palette is based on the key colors, black and white. The rest of the color sets are generated by a base color, and then shades towards the defined black and white colors. This is done using the css `color-mix()` function.

The project is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
